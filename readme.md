# DraiWiki
Since the old code has become very messy and difficult to work with, I have decided to
rewrite the software from scratch.

Apologies for the inconvenience; hopefully there'll be a working version of DraiWiki in
no time! The old code is still there, and those of you are interested in getting a copy
are more than welcome to send an email to dev [at] robertmonden [dot] com.
